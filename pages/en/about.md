A Personal Note
---------------

I like to read, mainly [Science Fiction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction), [Cyberpunk](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk) and [Fantasy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasy). I am a big Terry Pratchett fan, and loved *The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy* by Douglas Adams. As much as I don't want to admit it, I genuinly enjoyed the *Harry Potter* novels by J.K. Rowling. I am very much desperate to read the final volume of *Game of Thrones* and still refuse to watch the TV series.

More recently I have been in what classifies as young adult literature: *Skullduggery Pleasant* by Darek Landy, *Lookwood & Co.* as well as *Bartimaeus* by Jonathan Strout and *The Invisible Library* by Genevieve Cogman. I also enjoed the LitRPG series *Awaken Online* by Travis Bagwell. 

Reading aside I passionately play Badminton at the [TV Roetgen](http://www.tv-roetgen.de/). A couple of year ago I started learning to play the guitar. I think I am (ever so slowly) improving my skills - mainly thatnks to [my guitar teacher Klaus](https://playtheguitar.de/). I started playing a Dreadnought Western Acoutistic Guitar but have in the meanwhile almost exclusively moved to playing an electric [Epiphone Les Paul Tribute Plus](https://www.musicstore.de/de_DE/EUR/Epiphone-Les-Paul-Tribute-Plus-Midnight-Sapphire/art-GIT0021302-000).

Professional Experience
-----------------------

    * _Senior Software Engineer, as of November 2020_

      More soon .. :)

    * _(Senior) Manager Software Engineering TTS - TTS Research & Development, May 2014 - October 2020_    

      During my time at Cerence//Nuance I worked in various management roles and led different teams.
      
      In my management career, among other things, I was responsible for the development of voice input (ASR, Automatic Speech Recognition) and voice output (TTS, text-to-speech) systems. In addition, I was responsible for
      the complete release infrastructure as well as the associated processes for the text-to-speech organization.

      I cultivated and still maintain an agile and cooperative management style and see myself more as a coach than as a boss.

      Whenever my time allowed it I - also as a manager - actively helped with develop, especially in the area of
      DevOps and automation, but also with development of web-based tools and demos, using tools and languages such as `Jenkins`, `Artifactory`, `BitBucket`, `Python` and `Groovy`. I do believe it is important to *eat your own dog food* and really understand your product (and the pains that come with developing it). 

    * _Senior Software Engineer - Embedded Research & Development, May 2012 - January 2014_
    
      As a Senior Sofware Engineer I took a leading role in the architecture and development of a framework for 
      embedded language systems using `C++`. As a `Scrum Master` I established Scrum as a process and then dealt a lot with building and developing the team.

      Worked as a software engineer in the Professional Services team. The main focus was the porting of the speech input and output engines to different `embedded platforms`. Furthermore, I took a leading role in the architecture and implementation of a software stack for executing remote procedure calls on a multi-processor (big-little, `ARM+DSP`) platform, using `C`.
        
    * _Student Employee, Intern, Graduand, December 2005 - August 2007_
    
      As a graduand, I work on the introduction and development of a process and the associated tools for the automatic tuning of the parameters of the `speech recognition` engine. The tools were created in `Python`. The process was based on best practices from projects.
      As an intern in the Professional Services Team I was mainly developing software with `C`.
      As a student employee I was working mostly on the preparation of language corpora for customer data collections as well as the development of tools to simplify the process.
