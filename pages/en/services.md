I am a professional software engineer and agile leader with many years of experience. 
I offer some consulting and development services.

If you are interested in working with me **[get in touch.]({{ 'contact/' | relative_url }})Â **

Continous Integreation and Continous Delivery CI/CD
---------------------------------------------------

I can support you and your company in builing a continous integration (CI) and delivery (CD) workflow for your
projects and products. I have many years of experience doing just that in a corporate environment based on tools
such as ``Jenkins``, ``Artifactory``, ``BitBucket`` and ``Docker``.

Sofware Design and Architecture
-------------------------------

I am an experienced software architect and have overseen multiple large development project and products over the years. If you need experience building low-level interfaces based on C or C++, building complex embedded software stacks, or even want to create a new RESTful API for your latest web-based product I can help you with all of that!

Python development
------------------

My experience with Python ranges from simple scripting to large and complex web application and RESTful services. 
I can work with you to get your next Python project or product off the ground quickly using frameworks such as 
``Django``, ``Flask`` and ``Click``. I can also support you in creating tests for your applications using ``pyunit`` and 
``robotframework``.

I can also support you with packaging and deployment of your tools and applications using for example ``setuptools``, 
``pip``, ``bumpversion`` and ``twine``.

Frontend development
--------------------

If you need support developing web pages and frontends using ``HTML5``, ``CSS`` and ``JavaScript`` be sure to 
**[get in touch]({{ 'contact/' | relative_url }})**. I can help your build your new frontend or update your existing
one based on frameworks such as as ``Bootstrap``, ``Angular`` and ``React``.


Static Page Generation
----------------------

If you are looking to provide your users with a blazingly fast web experience you will look at static page generation, using tools like Jekyll (which is also running this site!). I can help you get your user experience to the next level by developing a custom Jekyll site for you, including template development and deployment support.

Speech Input / Ouput development and integration
------------------------------------------------

Setting up and integrating a working speech input or output stack can be a daunting task. There are many things to consider like accuaracy, latency and quality. I can support you with the integration of speech technology into your products. My experience ranges from grammar based speech input (ASR - automatic speech recognition) to neural network based speech output (TTS - text to speech). I have worked in both fields, at the core of the technology, for many years.
