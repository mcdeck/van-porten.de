<p>I've been pondering the thought of buying a <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network-attached_storage">NAS</a> system for quite some time now but could not find a suitable one. My requirements are quite challenging though, I must admit:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Silent: I want to run the system near my desk so it has to be very silent. (And I mean super-silent - not just a little silent)</li>
<li>Fast: Access to the drives has to be fast.</li>
<li>Feature-Rich Software: I want to use the NAS primarily as a NAS, but it should offer features like BT downloading and the like. It should also act as a iTunes and/or DLNA server.</li>
<li>Hardware Features:<br />
- Wake-On-Lan / Wake-on-Wan<br />
- Inegrated WLAN Adapter<br />
- Raid 1, 5 or 10; 10 preferred</li>
</ul>
<p>I bought some off-the-shelf NAS, namely the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.synology.com/us/products/DS411slim/index.php">Synology DS411slim</a> and the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.acer.de/ac/de/DE/content/home-server">Acer easyStore H341</a>. Both were decent devices but were not really up to the challenge. I ended up returning both of them.</p>
<p>The easyStore was fast and feature-rich, running <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Home_Server">Windows Home Server</a> (not 2011, though, but the old one). However, it was noisy which I could not stand.</p>
<p>The DS411slim was silent enough and had some nice features via <a class="reference external" href="http://www.synology.com/dsm/index.php?lang=enu">DiskStation Manager</a>, but felt painfully slow when copying to and from the device. Plus it was rather expensive, working with 2.5" HDDs, and thus also very limited in storage capacity (4x1GB maximum).</p>
<p>After searching for some days now for suitably silent yet powerful device I could not come up with something good. There is the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wdc.com/en/products/products.aspx?id=290">Western Digitial MyBook WorldEdition II</a> but that did not receive many positive comments on Amazon (for example). Some even state it tends to loose data, which is quite against the point of buying a NAS in the first place. Also Buffalo seems to offers some decent devices but they are either only single drive solutions like the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.buffalotech.com/products/network-storage/home-and-small-office/linkstation-live-ls-chl/">LinkStation Live LS-CHL</a> or - like the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.buffalotech.com/products/network-storage/home-and-small-office/linkstation-pro-duo-ls-wvlr1/">LinkStation Pro Duo LS-WVLR1</a> - not very reliable (from what <a class="reference external" href="http://www.smallnetbuilder.com/content/view/30295/75/">reviews</a> say).</p>
<p>Other devices from QNAP (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.qnap.com/pro_detail_feature.asp?p_id=183">TS-419P+</a>), Synology (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.synology.com/products/spec.php?product_name=DS411%2BII〈=enu#p_submenu">DS411+II</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://www.synology.com/us/products/ds410/index.php">DS410</a>) and Thecus (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.thecus.com/product.php?PROD_ID=30">N4200</a>) all seem viable options. I feel though that any single one of them has one flaw or another. The QNAP TS-419P+ seems to be quite silent (though I could not find any absolute numbers yet) and offers RAID5. It runs an embedded linux and has a download manager built in. It feels quite pricy though at about €480,- (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B0047WHUMS/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=deadia-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1638&amp;creative=19454&amp;creativeASIN=B0047WHUMS">Amazon</a><img class="dgytnukqdokijrepwkwh" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/ir?t=&amp;l=as2&amp;o=3&amp;a=B0047WHUMS" alt="image0" />) without HDDs. The same holds basically for the DS411+II, which is even more pricy at €520,- (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B004CRH8HA/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=deadia-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1638&amp;creative=19454&amp;creativeASIN=B004CRH8HA">Amazon</a><img class="dgytnukqdokijrepwkwh" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/ir?t=&amp;l=as2&amp;o=3&amp;a=B004CRH8HA" alt="image1" />) without any drives again. The same holds for the DS410 at around €450,- (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B003A7OMS6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=deadia-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1638&amp;creative=19454&amp;creativeASIN=B003A7OMS6">Amazon</a><img class="dgytnukqdokijrepwkwh" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/ir?t=&amp;l=as2&amp;o=3&amp;a=B003A7OMS6" alt="image2" />).  Sadly, also the Thecus N4200 runs at a stunning €440,-<br />
(<a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B0034EG0TO/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=deadia-21&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1638&amp;creative=19454&amp;creativeASIN=B0034EG0TO">Amazon</a><img class="dgytnukqdokijrepwkwh" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/ir?t=&amp;l=as2&amp;o=3&amp;a=B0034EG0TO" alt="image3" />).  Also none of the above come with an integrated WLAN adapter.</p>
<p>That said, you can begin to feel that you should check other options as well, but which would that be? Easy: build your own NAS! That can't be more expensive, can it? The downside obviously is that it is a bit more work to set up such a system and also the maintenance might be harder.<br />
On the upside, you are free in choice of operating system and features and you could think about transforming your NAS into a HTPC if you chose components carefully. Also of interest is the question of power consumption compared to the other, more integrated solutions and lastly also the price of the rig.</p>
<p>In the next part of this article series I will present a selection of components that could be used to build a DIY NAS/HomeServer to suit my needs.</p>
