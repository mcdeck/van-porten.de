<p>After a day of experimentation with openHAB I finally decided to first build a prototype system, rather than cutting real wires and putting the actors in between. This is what my prototype looks like:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.van-porten.de/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/IMG_20141110_230439.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-342"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-342" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_20141110_230439-300x225.jpg" alt="IMG_20141110_230439" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>
<p>I must say it was in fact a good idea to start this way. The actors did not work yesterday for whatever reason, but after giving them a day to relax now and restarting my rPI they now work just fine. No more messages droppped no nothing. Maybe I will eventually figure out what the problem was, who knows.</p>
<p>On a different note, I tried out <a href="http://www.homegenie.it/" target="_blank">HomeGenie </a>today as an alternative to openHAB and will give it a try. It seems a bit more intuitive and easier to setup. I do wonder if it also matches the openHAB capabilities and versatility. More updates soon.</p>
