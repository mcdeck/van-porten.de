<p>When I first started running my Tycho/Maven build of my visual editor in<br />
Jenkins the build would always fail if a single test failed. That was<br />
mainly because the Maven build would run the surefire test automatically<br />
but cancel the build if there were any failures in them. In turn, this<br />
would not keep artifacts from being generated and thus not create a new<br />
snapshot release. To make matters worse, my tests are not that stable<br />
yet - running them on Linux sometimes fails for no reason whatsoever,<br />
leading to yet another broken build.</p>
<p>Now, this is obviously not what you (or Jenkins, for that matter) would<br />
expect to happen. What I wanted and what I guess you would normally want<br />
is for the build to pass but for Jenkins to mark the build as<br />
&quot;unstable&quot;.</p>
<p>To acomplish this on the command line, you simply need to tell Maven to<br />
ignore test failures</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><span class="go">mvn clean install -Dmaven.test.failure.ignore=true</span>
</pre>
</div>
<p>With Jenkins, this is equally straight forward:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://wordpress.van-porten.de/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/vREST-Config-Jenkins-Mozilla-Firefox_2012-01-21_17-45-38.png"><img alt="image0" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/vREST-Config-Jenkins-Mozilla-Firefox_2012-01-21_17-45-38.png" /></a></p>
<p>Now Jenkins acts nicely and reports unstable builds while still<br />
producing all artifacts.</p>
