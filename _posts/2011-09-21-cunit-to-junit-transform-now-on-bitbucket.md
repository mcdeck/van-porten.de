excerpt: CUnit-to-JUnit transform is now available on BitBucket
---
One of the most visited blog entries on this blog probably is my article on transforming [CUnit](http://cunit.sourceforge.net/) results to JUnit results: [CUnit Tests in Hudson](http://www.van-porten.de/2009/05/cunit-tests-in-hudson/). There I write about how to use [xsltproc](http://xmlsoft.org/XSLT/xsltproc2.html) to transform the output of CUnit to be processed by [Hudson](http://hudson-ci.org/)/[Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org/).

Now, I decided to put the file on [BitBucket](http://www.bitbucket.org) to maybe consolidate the contributions or changes others are making. I welcome everybody to make contributions to the transform there.
