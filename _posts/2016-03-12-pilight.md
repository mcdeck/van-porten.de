I recently read an article in the German computer magazine [c't](http://www.heise.de/ct) about [controlling simple plugin switches via pilight](http://www.heise.de/ct/ausgabe/2016-2-Funksteckdosen-und-mehr-mit-dem-Raspi-steuern-3057510.html). [Pilight](https://www.pilight.org/) is a small piece of software with a built in web-based GUI that can [control a variety of devices](https://wiki.pilight.org/doku.php/protocols). This intrigued me quite a bit since I still had a cheap Brennstuhl RCS 1000 N comfort lying around here, which is exactly the switch set used in the article and is apparently supported quite well by pilight.

So, of course, I sat down and ordered a [GPIO Full Kit from the pilight shop](https://www.pilight.org/shop/#) as well as a [DHT22/AMS2302 temperature and humidity sensor from Amazon](http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B00L3I91TO), plus [some resistors, cables and my very first bread board](http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B00DGNZ9G8).

The net result of the assembly, [following the instructions for wiring up the sender/receiver](https://manual.pilight.org/en/electronics-wiring) and [these instruction for wiring up the AMs2302](http://www.home-automation-community.com/temperature-and-humidity-from-am2302-dht22-sensor-displayed-as-chart/), looks a bit messy, but works splendidly :)

[![RaspberryPi wired to breadboard]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2016-03-11-23.06.36-300x225.jpg)]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/2016-03-11-23.06.36.jpg "Raspberry PI (old B+ for testing) wired up to 433Mhz sender/receiver and AMS2303 temperature/humidity sensor.")

Note that I intentionally left away the wiring for firmware updates because I wanted it to be as simple as possible for this test setup.

After finishing the hardware setup I went at the software part, which is quite straight forward.

``` bash
sudo su
echo "deb http://apt.pilight.org/ stable main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pilight.list
wget -O - http://apt.pilight.org/pilight.key | apt-key add -
apt-get update
apt-get install pilight
service pilight start
```

That is it, basically. You can now reach (an empty) pilight GUI on ``http://<yourhost>:5001.`` 

Figuring out the configuration you need is also fairly trivial. Simply start _**pilight-receive**_ as root and push the button on your remote, if you have one (my RCS 1000 N set came with one).

``` bash
sudo su
pilight-receive
```

You will see whatever is sent by the remote in your console. For my Brennstuhl switches I saw the following piece of code - next to some others which we do not need to care about too much now. According to the c't article they are backwards compatibility measure.

``` json
{
 "message": {
   "systemcode": 17,
   "unitcode": 2,
   "state": "on"
 },
 "origin": "receiver",
 "protocol": "elro_800_switch",
 "uuid": "0000-74-da-38-0091fa",
 "repeats": 1
}
```

The interesting parts are:

*   protocol: we need this to be able to tell pilight how to talk to devices
*   systemcode: to tell pilight the system code
*   unitcode: so pilight knows which device to talk to

With that information we can now create a config.json (_**/etc/pilight/config.json**_). The pilight wiki also [explains in some detail](https://wiki.pilight.org/doku.php/elro_he_switch_v7_0) how to do this for this kind of switch.

``` json
{
    "devices" : {
        "Brennstuhl_A" : {
            "protocol" : ["elro_800_switch"],
            "id" : [{
                    "systemcode" : 17,
                    "unitcode" : 1
                }
            ],
            "state" : "off"
        },
        "temperature" : {
            "protocol" : ["dht22"],
            "id" : [{
                    "gpio" : 7
                }
            ],
            "humidity" : 5.2,
            "temperature" : 1.7,
            "poll-interval" : 5
        }
    },
    "rules" : {},
    "gui" : {
        "Brennstuhl_A" : {
            "name" : "Brennstuhl A",
            "group" : ["Test"],
            "media" : ["all"],
            "readonly" : 0
        },
        "temperature" : {
            "name" : "Temperature Sensor",
            "group" : ["Test"],
            "media" : ["all"]
        }
    },
    "settings" : {
        "log-level" : 6,
        "pid-file" : "/var/run/pilight.pid",
        "log-file" : "/var/log/pilight.log",
        "webserver-enable" : 1,
        "webserver-root" : "/usr/local/share/pilight/",
        "webserver-http-port" : 5001,
        "webserver-cache" : 1
    },
    "hardware" : {
        "433gpio" : {
            "sender" : 0,
            "receiver" : 1
        }
    },
    "registry" : {
        "pilight" : {
            "version" : {
                "current" : "7.0"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Note the settings in devices and in GUI. You will also note that I already added the AM2303 sensor in the same way, using the DHT22 protocol. Also note the GPIO pin. If you follow the instructions I linked to earlier you will also have connected your AM2303 to GPIO pin 7, otherwise adjust as necessary (following the [wiringpi scheme](http://wiringpi.com/pins/)). Detailed instruction to configure that sensor are [found in the pilight wiki](https://wiki.pilight.org/doku.php/dht22_v7_0).

And that's that. Restart pilight and you should be good to go.

This now gives me a set of cheap switches I can play with. In a next step I am going to try and see if I can attach pilight to [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io/).
