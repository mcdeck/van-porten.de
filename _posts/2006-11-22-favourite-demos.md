I just tuned in to [demoscene.tv](http://www.demoscene.tv) and came to think of my five  
favourite demos of all times. Here we go in order of appereance:

1.  [VIP 2](http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=10) - [Popsy Team](http://www.popsyteam.org/)
2.  [Heaven seven](http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=5) - [exceed](http://www.exceed.hu/)
3.  [Poem to a horse](http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=5569) - [Farbrausch](http://www.farbrausch.de/)
4.  [Please the cookie thing](http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=232) - [aardbei](http://www.pouet.net/groups.php?which=86)
5.  [The popular demo](http://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=9450) - [Farbrausch](http://www.farbrausch.de/)

Most of these I like for no particular reason. VIP 2 is just way stylish  
and I remember me shakeing when I first watched it back in 2000. Heaven  
seven .. style. Poem to a horse for the nice Gfx and FX. PTCT .. another  
one of the demos I loved back in the days. I don't even know why. And  
The popular demo .. well .. it's jsut popular, so you gotta love it,  
don't you? :)

I for one like the idea and the .. let's say .. funky colors.
