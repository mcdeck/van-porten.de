excerpt: In this post we look at how to run and capture 
    cunit test in Hudson
---
Since I needed to parse the results of some [CUnit](http://cunit.sourceforge.net/) tests in [Hudson](https://hudson.dev.java.net/) in a recent project, I came up with the following transformation which I apply to the [cunit xml result file](http://cunit.sourceforge.net/doc/running_tests.html#automated).

Hudson can then evaluate the results as if they were generated by [JUnit](http://www.junit.org/). The same approach is basically used in the [CppUnit Plugin for Hudson](http://wiki.hudson-ci.org/display/HUDSON/CppUnit+Plugin) - which is where I got the idea.

Since I'm too lazy at the moment to write my own plugin for Hudson, I figured running [xsltproc](http://www.xmlsoft.org/XSLT/xsltproc2.html) after running my tests will be good enough:

``` console
xsltproc-win32xsltproc.exe --stringparam suitename testall -o testall_results.xml cunit-to-junit.xsl cunit_testall-Results.xml
```

To make CUnit produce XML results, you have to do something like this:

``` c
CU_set_output_filename( "cunit_testall" );
CU_list_tests_to_file();
CU_automated_run_tests();
```

**You can [download the cunit-to-junit.xsl here](http://www.van-porten.de/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/cunit-to-junit.xsl).**

The file with syntax highlighting follows. **Listing removed because the highlighting broke the XSLT syntax. Use the [downloadable file](http://www.van-porten.de/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/cunit-to-junit.xsl) instead!** Please note that it is not yet complete as I haven't really tested it with all possible results cunit can produce. That I will do at a later time. Maybe togehter with a Hudson Plugin.

**EDIT**: The xslt transform is now also available on BitBucket. If you have made modifications feel free to contribute them there: [http://www.van-porten.de/2011/09/cunit-to-junit-transform-now-on-bitbucket/](http://www.van-porten.de/2011/09/cunit-to-junit-transform-now-on-bitbucket/)
