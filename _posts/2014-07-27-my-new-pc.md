After some five years I finally decided it was time to say goodbye to my old desktop PC, an old [Intel Core2Quad Q9550](http://ark.intel.com/products/33924/Intel-Core2-Quad-Processor-Q9550-12M-Cache-2_83-GHz-1333-MHz-FSB)  with 8GB RAM and an somewhat ancient [Sapphire Radeon HD4870](http://www.sapphiretech.com/presentation/product/product_index.aspx?pid=179&lid=1).  I abandoned all components except my two SSDs; one [Intel 320 (120GB)](http://ark.intel.com/products/56563/Intel-SSD-320-Series-120GB-2_5in-SATA-3Gbs-25nm-MLC) and one [Samsung SSD 840 PRO (256GB). ](http://www.samsung.com/global/business/semiconductor/minisite/SSD/uk/html/about/SSD840Pro.html)This also means that I replaced my [Antec P180](http://www.silentpcreview.com/article249-page1.html) with a new enclsoure.

Goals for the new system were primarily performance combined with low noise emissions.  Five years ago, when I was building my old system, it was much more complicated to get a decent system at low noise levels. However, this has become a very easy feat recently, thanks to many great cases and low-noise cooling systems being available. It seems that the computer industry is finally picking up on that trend.

Now, finally, for the components I've put into the new system.

I have not run any benchmarks yet, as I am still waiting for the Windows 8.1 installation to finish. That is quite a time consuming process when you have to start from a Windows 8 installation disk and work your way through all the updates.

The system is very silent when running Windows, though. The [Nanoxia Deep Silence 5](http://www.nanoxia-world.com/product/1/56/Deep+Silence+5+) is an excellent case with excellent cable management plus the components I chose all feature low-noise fans, so I would think that this helped a lot. I'll see how it performs under load.
