<p>Since I bought a new Z-Wave controller recently (<a title="ZME_UZB" href="http://www.z-wave.me/index.php?id=28" target="_blank">ZME_UZB which support Z-Wave PLUS</a>) I was now facing an issue there I needed to remove a device from my old controller (ZME_Z-StickC). However, I did not have the old controller available.</p>
<p>Including Z-Wave devices that are already registered with another Z-Wave network does not work immediately. The device needs to be factory reset first.</p>
<p><strong>Resetting the device is easy also without the original controller, once you know how:</strong><br />
Simply use <em><strong>ANY</strong> </em>controller and put into <em>EXCLUSION</em> mode. Afterwards, follow the instructions for exclusion of your device (e.g. tripple-click one of the buttons on my switch).</p>
<p>After that, the device is excluded (from its original network, although another controller triggered the exclude) and thus reset to factory defaults. Once that has happened inclusion works again.</p>
