<p>After struggling with installing <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ubuntu.com/server">Ubuntu Server 10.04</a> from a bootable<br />
usb stick, here are some hints in case anyone else ever wants to do<br />
this. My problem was that the Server Installer kept trying to load files<br />
from the CD and could not find them, which made the installation fail. I<br />
actually wonder why it could not find anything because it was apparently<br />
looking in the right places (i.e. the USB stick mounted under /cdrom).<br />
Feel free to enlighten me. Read more after the break.</p>
<p>Anyway, first, you'll of course need the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.ubuntu.com/server/get-ubuntu/download">Ubuntu Server Iso Image</a> and<br />
the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.pendrivelinux.com/downloads/Universal-USB-Installer/Universal-USB-Installer.exe">Universal USB Install</a> in case you're on Windows or the 'Startup<br />
Disc Creator' in case you're already running Ubuntu.</p>
<p>Then, you'll need to follow the guide to creating a usb stick as posted<br />
on the<a class="reference external" href="http://www.ubuntu.com/server/get-ubuntu/download">download page</a> when you click 'Show me how'. That is, run the<br />
Disc Create / USB Installer and follow the instructions. It's actually<br />
pretty straight forward so I'm not going to post it again. :)</p>
<p><strong>Next, and this is important, copy the iso you downloaded onto the USB<br />
stick, as we will need it later when we booted into the installation.</strong></p>
<p>Now, boot the system from the USB stick you just created. This will<br />
start the installation where you can first choose a language and the<br />
like. After a while, as I already wrote, the installer failed for me<br />
with &quot;missing data from cdrom&quot;, bringing me to the installation menu.<br />
From there, you can choose to open a shell. Do so.</p>
<p>Once the shell is there, execute:</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><span class="go">mount</span>
</pre>
</div>
<p>and note the device that is mounted as /cdrom. This is your usb stick.</p>
<p>Next, execute the following commands:</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><span class="go">umount /cdrom</span>
<span class="go">mkdir /usb</span>
<span class="gp">#</span>device_name is the one from mount
<span class="go">mount /dev/device_name /usb</span>
<span class="go">mount -t iso9660 -o loop /usb/ubuntu-10.04-server-amd64.iso /cdrom</span>
</pre>
</div>
<p>The iso name of course depends on the version of the server you<br />
downloaded. for me, it was the 64 bit version.</p>
<p>Next, you can exit the shell:</p>
<div class="highlight">
<pre><span class="go">exit</span>
</pre>
</div>
<p>This will take you back to the installation menu.</p>
<p>Select &quot;Load preseed&quot; (or similiarly named - can't quite remember right<br />
now). The installation should now continue normally.</p>
