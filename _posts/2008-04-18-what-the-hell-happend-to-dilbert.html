<p>While enjoying my <a class="reference external" href="http://www.shaneliesegang.com/projects/coffee.php">morning coffee</a> which includes <a class="reference external" href="http://www.dilbert.com/">The Daily Dilbert</a><br />
I was again made aware of how much site redesign can suck.</p>
<p>And I guess Dilbert.com is one of the worst examples. The site went from<br />
straight forward and simple (and, of course, funny) to being<br />
rediculously 'blinky' and flooded with useless information. I couln't<br />
even find todays comic strip at first.</p>
<p>I can only hope that this is a late April's Fools Joke by Scott<br />
Adams....</p>
<p>Having Dilbert in colour is nice and all. Having an animated Dilbert<br />
once a week might be a good enough gimick to some folks to justify such<br />
a radical not to say stupid redesign. I for one would rather have the<br />
good old black and white daily dilbert without all the fuzz that's seems<br />
to be coming about with new site now.</p>
<p>It's not that I think changes is bad per say. It's just that bad changes<br />
are bad. I might even consider removing Dilbert from my morning coffee<br />
and just wait for the daily dilber per mail. I can only hope that -<br />
should that 'service' be continued - the mails won't become bloated as<br />
bloated as the new site.</p>
