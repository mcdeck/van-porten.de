<h1>What is a task board?</h1>
<p>A task board is typically a phyisical whiteboard that an agile team uses to track their progress. The notion of a task board is most prominently used in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_%28development%29" target="_blank">Software Kanban</a>, where the board is the one central information hub the team works with.</p>
<h1>Why a web-based tool?</h1>
<p>Unfortunately it is not always possible to colocate teams. Traceability requirements also might force the use of a digital tool for tracking user stories or tasks.</p>
<p>A web-based tool can offer almost the same features that a phyisical board can do. It provides a simple web-based view on team commitments and lets the team work with this.</p>
<h1>How is this board different from others?</h1>
<p>There are a million other great tools out there (for example, <a href="http://www.rallydev.com/" target="_blank">Rally</a> and <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/agile" target="_blank">Jira with Jira Agile</a>, just to name two). However, there is a common flaw in al those tools: They require you switch your your tracking tool completely.</p>
<p>While that might be possible in some situations, in others you might be tied to a certain tool and cannot change. And for that tool there might just be no task boards available.</p>
<p>Finally, switching to a completely new tool is disruptive. Why swap out a complete (working) stack of software for something else, just to have a digital task board?</p>
<h1>The Idea</h1>
<p>The idea of this task board is hence to offer a vendor-independant board. That is, there will be adapters for various vendors. Currently, the plan foresees to support Mantis and Bugzilla.</p>
<p>The concept has already been proven to work with a prototype on FogBugz, so a FogBugz port of this new version will also be done in due time.</p>
<p>Other systems depend on community support (or can become sponsored development efforts if someone is willing to pay for it instead of doing it themselves - <a title="Contact" href="http://www.van-porten.de/contact/" target="_blank">get in touch</a>).</p>
<h1>Technology</h1>
<p>Not decided yet. The prototype is based on <a href="http://www.python.org" target="_blank">Python</a> and <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/" target="_blank">Django</a>. I am thinking of developing the final version in <a href="https://grails.org/" target="_blank">Grails</a> or maybe <a href="https://spring.io/" target="_blank">Spring</a> directly.</p>
<h1>Screenshots</h1>
<p>Here is a first screenshot of a design-concept for the new version. The old one does look a lot uglier (still get's the job done perfectly).</p>

<h1>Downloads</h1>
<p>Not available yet, obviously. I will update the pages here as soon as versions become available.</p>
<h1>License</h1>
<p>Will be something open-source, haven't finally decided which license exactly.</p>
