**Note: The server hosting the site was taken offline beginning of 2014 and as such the site no longer exists.**

The homepage for the infamous IRC channel [#gamedev.ger (on euIRC.net)](irc://euirc.net/#gamedev.ger).

The page can be found on [http://gamedev.dword.org](http://gamedev.dword.org) and looks like this:

[![gamedev_ger]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/gamedev_ger.png)](http://gamedev.dword.org)

I did this page together with [Jan Althaus (aka. tciny)](http://www.tciny.net/) who really is a very talented artist.

We used PHP and the Smarty template engine for the page.

It is conceptually akin to developia.de in that it is solely driven by the community who should create content for the site. However, and I'm rather proud of this, Jan and I launched at least half a year before developia went online ;).
