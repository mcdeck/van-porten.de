**Developia.de has been merged with zfx.info under the leadership of zfx.info effective September 5. 2010, discontinuing developia.de as a project. However, the latest version of developia.de has been archived and can still be found under http://da.zfx.info/developia/.**

Developia.de was (maybe still is) Germany's biggest community for hobby- and semi-professional developers. The platform is almost completely community driven, i.e. content is generated by the users.

The current version of developia.de can be found - go figure - under [http://www.developia.de](http://www.developia.de) and looks like this:

![developia current]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/developia_current.png)

There is also a beta version available which has a new designed and a somewhat revamped code base. It can be found on [http://beta.developia.de/developia/](http://beta.developia.de/forum/) and looks like this:

![developia beta]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/developia_beta.png)

The beta never actually went into production and probably never will. There had been plans to improve developia.de further and maybe at some point make it profitable, but that never happened.

Sadly, I'm too busy with other projects and activites which is why there have been no efforts to revive developia.de or (better put) development of new features from my side lately.

To the best of my knowledge [Matt](http://digitalbreed.com/) from [sechstasinn](http://www.sechsta-sinn.de/) has been putting some effort into fixing bugs recently, though.

There also is still quite some activity on the site itself from the users to not all hope is lost :).

Maybe in time there will be more progress and/or new features, also on my part (maybe as soon as I finish my Master's or so).
